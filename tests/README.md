## Docker-compose

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

    version: "3.3"

    services:
        mysql:
            image: elestio/mysql:8.0
            restart: always
            hostname: mysql
            volumes:
                - ./storage/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
            env_file:

            links:
                - mysql:mysql
            ports:
                - "172.17.0.1:22811:80"
            environment:
            PMA_HOST: mysql
            PMA_PORT: 3306
            PMA_USER: root
            PMA_PASSWORD: ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}
            UPLOAD_LIMIT: 500M
            MYSQL_USERNAME: glpi
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}
            depends_on:

|       DOMAIN        | your.domain.com |
| MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD |  your-password  |
|   MYSQL_DATABASE    |     glpidb      |

# Maintenance

## Logging

The Elestio GLPI Docker image sends the container logs to stdout. To view the logs, you can use the following command:

    docker-compose logs -f

To stop the stack you can use the following command:

    docker-compose down

## Backup and Restore with Docker Compose

To make backup and restore operations easier, we are using folder volume mounts. You can simply stop your stack with docker-compose down, then backup all the files and subfolders in the folder near the docker-compose.yml file.

Creating a ZIP Archive
For example, if you want to create a ZIP archive, navigate to the folder where you have your docker-compose.yml file and use this command:

    zip -r myarchive.zip .

Restoring from ZIP Archive
To restore from a ZIP archive, unzip the archive into the original folder using the following command:

    unzip myarchive.zip -d /path/to/original/folder

Starting Your Stack
Once your backup is complete, you can start your stack again with the following command:

    docker-compose up -d

That's it! With these simple steps, you can easily backup and restore your data volumes using Docker Compose.
